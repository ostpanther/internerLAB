                                    Методы для key-word extractions:


1)         Simple Statistical Approaches

1.1) Word Frequency (‘bag of words’) -  Word frequency consists of listing the words and phrases that repeat the most within a text.
    But leaving aside crucial aspects related to the meaning,structure, grammar, and sequence of words.
    Synonyms, for example, can’t be detected by this keyword extraction method, dismissing very valuable information.

1.2) Word Collocations and Co-occurrences (N-gram statistics) - The most common types of collocations are bi-grams \
    (two terms that appear adjacently, ‘customer service’) and tri-grams (a group of three words) 

1.3) TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency), \
    a formula that measures how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents.
    This metric calculates the number of times a word appears in a text (term frequency \
    and compares it with the inverse document frequency (how rare or common that word is in the entire data set).

1.4) RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction ) -  \
    is a well-known keyword extraction method which uses a list of stopwords and phrase delimiters \
    to detect the most relevant words or phrases in a piece of text.


2)          Linguistic Approaches

2.1) Graph-based Approaches

3)          Machine Learning Approaches

3.1) Conditional Random Fields (CRF) -  is a statistical approach that learns patterns \
    by weighting different features in a sequence of words present in a text. 

3.2) ROUGE (recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation) - is a family of metrics \
    that compares different parameters (like the number of overlapping words) \
    between the source text and the extracted words.

4)          Hybrid Approaches
4.1) Just combine 2-3 approaches
